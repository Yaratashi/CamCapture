In this code I tried to extract the frames coming 
from the video display and save them for every 5 seconds. 
-----
With the function time.sleep(), we are able to delay 
the process of the code for a period and then after 
the determinate time, we take the first frame that 
comes and save it in our system. 
---------
more changes are coming , starting from: 
- Change the name of the saved frames
- link the code to the online storage and save the frame there
